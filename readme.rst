Walking System Identification
-----------------------------

- Finish reading the van der Kooij paper

  - Section 2
  - Section 3
  - Section 4

- See if our controller can drive an OpenSim model or Ton's 2D model

  - Investigate the 2D models in Open Sim
  - Try running an OpenSim Model
  - Reproduce the sample controller that is in OpenSimm

- Wrap Ton's walking model from his tutorial

  - Go through "Learn C the Hard Way" to get back up to speed in the
    language

    - Exercise 13
    - Exercise 14
    - Exercise 15
    - Exercise 16

  - Try simple Cython wrapping
  - Read about MEX functions in Matlab
  - Try using SWIG for Matlab/Octave wrapping

- Wrap the HBM C code

  - try out the cython wrapping I started, need the source for hbm or a
    shared library though

- Test out running with perturbations on the treadmill

Lab Website
-----------

- Duplicate website backups offsite (on our NAS or S3 bucket)
- Complete the Diazo rules in the theme and upload to the website
- Add all the buttons I've clicked to the generic settings and push to live
  server
- Setup workflow for website for pulishing public documents
- Investigate ways to display publication lists on the website

  - check into embedding zotero collections into a page
  - check into using CMFBibliographyAT with Plone 4.3

- Figure out how to display the event date instead of the creation date in
  the rss feed: https://github.com/csu-hmc/hmc.csuohio.edu/issues/1
